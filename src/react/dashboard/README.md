## Getting Started

### Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run start
   ```

3. Access the dashboard at:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard
   ```

### Building for Production

1. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your web server.

## Implementation Notes

### Authentication

The dashboard is protected and only accessible to authenticated users. The `AuthContext` manages authentication state and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.

### Firebase Integration

The dashboard uses Firebase Authentication and Firestore for data storage. The security rules in `firestore-dashboard-rules.txt` should be applied to your Firebase project to secure your data.

### Deployment Steps

1. Build the project using `npm run build`
2. Test the new dashboard thoroughly
3. When ready to switch over:
   - Replace the existing `dashboard.html` with the redirect version (`dashboard-redirect.html`)
   - Upload the build files to your hosting service
   - Apply the security rules to your Firebase project

### Future Enhancements

- Add real-time data fetching from Firestore
- Implement charts for progress visualization
- Add notification system for upcoming sessions
- Create mobile app version using React Native

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication issues**: Check Firebase authentication settings and make sure your project configuration is correct.
- **Missing data**: Verify Firestore security rules and data structure.
- **Routing problems**: Ensure your server is configured to handle client-side routing properly.
